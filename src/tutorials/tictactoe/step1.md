# Welcome to Girl Code meets Meteor workshop!
<p class="flow-text">On this page, we'll explain how to get ready for the workshop.</p>
## Installation
### Windows

Download the official [Meteor installer](https://install.meteor.com/windows)

### OS X or Linux

Install the latest official Meteor release from your terminal:
`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

Once Meteor is installed, run the following code in your Terminal (for Mac or Linux users) or the command prompt (for Windows users):

```
  mkdir Projects
  cd Projects
  meteor create tictactoe
```

Then, run the project from your terminal / command prompt:

```
  cd tictactoe
  meteor
```

You can test the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser. Please use Google Chrome. The rest of the tutorial assumes that you are using Chrome as browser.

Now, open [Atom](https://atom.io/) where you can edit your project. On Windows, right-click in the `/tictactoe` folder and choose `Open with Atom`. Otherwise, you can launch Atom and go to File -> Open and choose `/projects/tictactoe` directory.
